# Tic-tac-toe

This project is a competitive style Tic-Tac-Toe that uses a point system to keep track
of the number of times that you have won. Each time you win a game, you are awarded 50
points. Once you have won twice, you will be awarded a consolation prize of a picture
of a potato. Scores are recorded to a txt file when you close the game. There is also
an unranked mode if you dont want your utter defeat to be recorded.

Starting a ranked game is easy. At the top of the window there is an add player button.
Simply click the button and enter your name. Repeat this step to add a friend. Please 
note that you must enter two players to play a ranked match. When youre ready to begin
click the start button for a coin toss on who goes first. After the game is over, you
can play again by clicking new game.

To start an unranked match, skip the add players button and press begin turn. Scores
in this game mode will not be recorded, but if you want to win the consolation prize,
this game mode isn't for you.

The consolation prize photos was pulled from the following site:
